    "title": "1. Safety Instructions",
    "description": "Electric scooter is a recreational device rather than a transporter. But once you ride it into a public community, it will also act as a transporter. Like \nany riding products, an electric scooter can and is intended to move and it is therefore, of course, possible to get into dangerous situations.\nPlease understand that you can reduce the risks by following all the instructions and warnings in this manual, but you cannot eliminate all the risks. \nRemember that whenever you ride the scooter you risk injury or death from loss of control, collisions, and falls. The electric scooter is intended for \nuse on \ufb02at pavement or level ground without bumps and obstacles. Be alert and slow down when entering unfamiliar areas.\nAlways wear a helmet when riding. Use an approved bicycle or scooter helmet that \ufb01ts properly with the chin strap in place, and provides protection \nfor the back of your head. A long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and athletic shoes are recommended. Never ride in higheels sandals or barefooted. Long \nhair or bangs that can a\ufb00ect vision should be tied up to avoid accidents caused by hair blocking vision.\nDo not attempt your \ufb01rst ride in any area where you might encounter children, pedestrians, pets, vehicles, bicycles, or other obstacles and potential \nhazards.\nRespect the rights and property of others. Pass on the left whenever possible. When approaching a pedestrian from the front, stay to the right and \nslow down. Be careful to avoid pedestrians, especially the old, children, the disabled, pregnant women. When approaching from behind, announce \nyourself and slow down to walking speed when passing. Please obey local tra\ufb03c laws and regulations if situation is di\ufb00erent.\nIn places without laws comply with the safety guidelines outlined in this manual. INMOTION will not be responsible for any property damage, personal \ninjury/death, accidents, or legal disputes caused by violations of the safety instructions.\nDo not allow anyone to ride your scooter on his/her own unless they have carefully read this manual and followed the riding guide video. The safety \nof new riders is your responsibility. Assist new riders until they are comfortable with the basic operation of the scooter. Make sure each new rider \nwears a helmet and other protective gear.\nBefore each ride check for loose fasteners and damaged components. If the scooter makes abnormal sounds or signals an alarm, immediately stop \nriding. Diagnose your scooter via the INMOTION App and contact after-sales service at service@imscv.com.\nBe alert! Scan both far ahead and in front of your scooter - your eyes are your best tool for safely avoiding obstacles and low traction surfaces\n(including, but not limited to, wet ground, loose sand, loose gravel, and ice).\n1.
