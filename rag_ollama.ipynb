Safety Instructions', 'description': 'Electric scooter is a recreational device rather than a transporter. But once you ride it into a public community, it will also act as a transporter. Like \\nany riding products, an electric scooter can and is intended to move and it is therefore, of course, possible to get into dangerous situations.\\nPlease understand that you can reduce the risks by following all the instructions and warnings in this manual, but you cannot eliminate all the risks. \\nRemember that whenever you ride the scooter you risk injury or death from loss of control, collisions, and falls. The electric scooter is intended for \\nuse on ﬂat pavement or level ground without bumps and obstacles. Be alert and slow down when entering unfamiliar areas.\\nAlways wear a helmet when riding. Use an approved bicycle or scooter helmet that ﬁts properly with the chin strap in place, and provides protection \\nfor the back of your head. A long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and athletic shoes are recommended. Never ride in higheels sandals or barefooted. Long \\nhair or bangs that can aﬀect vision should be tied up to avoid accidents caused by hair blocking vision.\\nDo not attempt your ﬁrst ride in any area where you might encounter children, pedestrians, pets, vehicles, bicycles, or other obstacles and potential \\nhazards.\\nRespect the rights and property of others. Pass on the left whenever possible. When approaching a pedestrian from the front, stay to the right and \\nslow down. Be careful to avoid pedestrians, especially the old, children, the disabled, pregnant women. When approaching from behind, announce \\nyourself and slow down to walking speed when passing. Please obey local traﬃc laws and regulations if situation is diﬀerent.\\nIn places without laws comply with the safety guidelines outlined in this manual. INMOTION will not be responsible for any property damage, personal \\ninjury/death, accidents, or legal disputes caused by violations of the safety instructions.\\nDo not allow anyone to ride your scooter on his/her own unless they have carefully read this manual and followed the riding guide video. The safety \\nof new riders is your responsibility. Assist new riders until they are comfortable with the basic operation of the scooter. Make sure each new rider \\nwears a helmet and other protective gear.\\nBefore each ride check for loose fasteners and damaged components. If the scooter makes abnormal sounds or signals an alarm, immediately stop \\nriding. Diagnose your scooter via the INMOTION App and contact after-sales service at service@imscv.com.\\nBe alert! Scan both far ahead and in front of your scooter - your eyes are your best tool for safely avoiding obstacles and low traction surfaces\\n(including, but not limited to, wet ground, loose sand, loose gravel, and ice).\\n1.

      "**Before You Ride (Safety & Handling)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Battery Care:** This section is crucial. It details how to handle and charge the battery safely: \n",
      "    * Never touch battery terminals - this can cause severe electric shocks, fires, or damage.\n",
      "    * Avoid throwing the battery in fire. It could lead to explosions, overheating, etc.\n",
      "    * Do not attempt to disassemble the battery without proper authorization. Users cannot repair the battery because the design is intended solely for transportation by the customer. \n",
      "    *  Charge regularly after each use - avoid completely draining it to extend battery life, especially for long-term storage.\n",
      "    * Don't leave or dispose of batteries in a fire as this could cause severe damage to them and put off dangerous fumes. Follow local regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Environmental Responsibility:** The manual urges users to dispose of old batteries responsibly according to local regulations. \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Temperature & Performance:** Users are warned about riding in extreme temperatures, emphasizing the impact on ride range.\n",
      "* **Understanding Your Scooter:** The user guide is explicit: don't ride if you're unsure how to operate it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Safety and Maintenance Reminders (Before each use):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Inspection and Maintenance:** Before every use, thoroughly check: \n",
      "    * Wheels, Steering, brakes, handlebar, and any other parts for loose connections or damage.\n",
      "    * Tire Pressure\n",
      "    * Battery Level - Ensure the battery is fully charged at least one week before taking a ride.  \n",
      "* **Riding Responsibly:** This section covers more practical tips like avoiding rough roads to prevent speed bumps from causing instability. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Security Reminders for Riding:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* You'd get detailed instructions if this was indeed a guide for a personal electric scooter, especially after-sales help is provided on how to handle any issues or use the services in case of danger while riding.\n",
      " \n",
      " **Key Points to Consider**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Brand and Model Specificity:** The manual strongly emphasizes the specific model of the scooter being used (like \"INMOTION,\" \"InMotion\", and specific reference to serial number) due to the technical features this device might have. \n",
      "  This is crucial as safety instructions may change drastically depending on the brand, and the use or the type of scooter (e-bike, e-scooter). This needs additional information for a complete safety guide. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
